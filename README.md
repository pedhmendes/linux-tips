# Linux Tips

## Droidcam
Useful app for those who don't have a webcam. You can install the app on your android phone and then run this script to install the client. You can play on any web site or directly in your PC. To use in your PC I recommend the VLC player. After you install the client in your PC and the app in your phone run the droidcam, open he VLC and press *CTRL + C* and press play.
